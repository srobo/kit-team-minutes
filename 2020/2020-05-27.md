# Meeting 2020-05-27

## Kit Collection

We have made a proposal to the CTC. Awaiting response from them. We will proceed with this plan if they are happy with it.

Plan is to leave as many kits with teams as possible so that they can be used again next year.

## Minutes

Following Kier's departure from the committee, Dan will take over minuting of meetings.

## Dev Tooling Team

Rob and Tom have contacted some potential volunteers to form the Dev Tooling Team.
