## Formation of Brain Team

**Background:**
A number of people have filled-in our sign-up form for volunteering to
be in our various project teams.

**Proposal:**
Our priorities have changed due to Covid-19.  Rather than trying to
form the assets and support teams, we should instead prioritise
forming the brain team as there is plenty of work that can be done
under current circumstances by this team, and we have a good number of
people who are interested in joining this team.  We should form the
brain team with the following people:

 - Dan Trickey
 - Jenny Fletcher
 - Dominik Kwiatek
 - Ash Sorrel Holland
 - Tommy Poll

**Resolution:**
3 in favour.  Motion passed.
