## Attendees

### Present

- Karina Kwiatek
- Jake Howard
- Will Barber
- Terra Barber
- Keith Emerson

### Apologies

## Topics

### Mentoring

- Haven't explicitly checked in a while
- No news is likely good news
- Some teams are a concern, but they're being actively mentored
- Team Supervisors seem less engaged this year

### Competitor resources

- Mostly on hold until post-competition

### Kit issues

- A theme of people struggling with serial comms
    - Hopefully we can improve this with documentation on how to do proper serial comms
- Another KCH died recently due to ground loops
    - Hard to do, so nothing particularly to worry about
- Perhaps useful to review Discord after the competition as to what people are using their Arduino for
    - Optimise what we have for how people are actually using them
    - Jake to open task to capture us doing this
    - Reviewing USB contents after the competition would also help

### Competition

#### Helpdesk

- Helpdesk system exists
    - Needs updates
- Karina to import teams and locations
- Jake to update deployment for this year
- Runbook docs have been updated to cover new processes / systems

#### Kit return

- We're happy with the plan
- We should condense boxes to make collation simpler
    - Once teams have left

### Kit Recovery

- TMD
    - Hoping to dispatch today
- JAG
    - Delivered according to tracking
- GHS
    - We need to send them the information
        - Jake has now done this

### Kit collation

- We should book something in soon
    - Horsham might be most viable?
    - Can potentially get a cheap van from Southampton
- Hopefully condensed down into fewer boxes so easier to transport around
