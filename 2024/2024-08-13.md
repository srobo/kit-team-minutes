    - Better code killing (from `sbot`)
    - Save argument on `robot.camera.see`
    - Dependency bumps
    - Robot constructor argument to skip power board requirement
    - Documentation
        - Comp mode USBs

- Pre-kickstart challenges (simulator)
    - Using externally-created assets
        - This is likely the cause of a large number of physics issues
        - It's probably a bad idea
        - Hard to properly test vs Webots primitives
    - Multiple worlds
        - More work than is necessary?
        - Against the spirit?
        - Just as productive to build something simple
    - Custom robots
        - Incredibly complex
        - Detecting components is possible, but uniquely identifying could be difficult
        - Opens up more potential physics issues
        - There's an editor, but it's poorly maintained https://github.com/cyberbotics/robot-designer
    - Request perhaps goes against original spirit?
        - More challenges, not a bootstrapping activity
        - Back to competition committee
