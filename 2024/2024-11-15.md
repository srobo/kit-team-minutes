## Topics

### Mentoring

- Keith has had success talking to a team
- 4 mentors assigned, 6 total, 8 teams
    - Just need to match a few more teams
    - Matching by time first (remote mentoring is better than no mentoring)
    - Assigning
        - Karina to work with Jake on assigning mentors

- Discord seems quiet
    - It's only been a month
    - The start is usually quiet

- Milestones
    - What should be done before Christmas?
        - Initial design (could be tweaked in future)
        - Idea how to assemble it
        - BOM
        - Sources for parts
        - Motors, wheels mechanisms are priority, since wood etc can be obtained easily

- "How are you getting on?" email
    - Thinking about
        - How to get to Christmas milestone (see above)
    - Where to source parts
    - How to get help?
        - Discord
        - Do you have a mentor?
        - No such thing as a silly question
    - Any notable problems you're having?

### Competitor resources

- We have a good list of content
- Jake still needs to turn them into actionable (and semi-refined) issues
- Some are more timely than others
- Keith is interested in working on types of motors etc
- Once issues are created, they can be more refined as a group and hopefully given to volunteers

### Simulator

- Will needs to cut a release
    - Mostly quality of life improvements
- Should we be advocating for update?
    - Library inclusions will be helpful
- Python 3.13 is not supported (flag this better)
- The libraries page could do with some updates
    - More information on packages
    - Differences with simulator vs robot
