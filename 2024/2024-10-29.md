# Kit Team Meeting 2024-10-29

## Attendees

### Present

- Karina Kwiatek
- Jake Howard
- Will Barber
- Keith Emerson
- Alex Colville

### Apologies

## Topics

### Competitor resources

- Without movement, it can be hard to motivate competitors

#### Resources for mentors

- Unclear what it should involve
- Getting to a moving robot
    - Building a chassis
        - Where to purchase things
        - Parts choices
            - Omniwheels
            - Stepper motors vs encoders
    - Making a robot which moves
    - Turning
- Don't want to be too prescriptive on the right process

#### Sensors

- Which sensors are useful?
- We see lots of vision-only
- Lots of teams try and build their own vision system
    - Not especially well - computer vision is difficult
- Don't consider the boards in isolation
    - Think of your robot as a whole

### Mentoring

- The earlier we can allocate mentors, the better
- Karina to explicitly reach out to mentors to confirm which teams they should reach out to

### Outputs

- Tutorials
    - How to do encoders
        - Building switches

        - What does the data mean / how to use it
        - Turning to face a marker

        - Motion blur
    - Localization
        - Benefits of absolute positioning
