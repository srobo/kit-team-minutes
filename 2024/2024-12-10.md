## Topics

### Mentoring

- Keith is helping out a few teams with motor selection
    - Would be good to get it written down and turned into a docs page
- Most teams who requested one now have a mentor
    - Just 2 empty slots
- Perhaps a mentoring push
    - Likely mentioned in a December update email from teams support

### Competitor resources

- https://github.com/orgs/srobo/projects/25/views/1
- How do we get people involved
    - Things are going to slow down over Christmas - and that's ok
    - Perhaps an email to volunteers
    - Alex to include reference in upcoming volunteer email
- Jake to post in Slack

- Avoiding wildcard imports
    - It's still useful to document the enums, as some may find it useful.
    - Perhaps worth calling out explicitly how to use an enum
    - Teams compare against `robot.mode`, so it should be expanded here how to compare properly

### Simulator

- No update

### Kit issues

- Confusion around where to import enum
