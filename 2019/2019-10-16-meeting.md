Date/time of meeting: Wednesday 16th October 2019, 19:30

Present: Kajetan Champlewski, Kier Davis, Rob Gilton, Dan Trickey


## Simulator

**Background:**
The Kickstart microgames make reference to the simulator, but the kit team currently have no plans to get the simulator into a shippable state for SR2020 Kickstart, and are unlikely to have the resources to do so.

**Proposal:**
Recommend to the Competition Team that we will not be providing a simulator for the SR2020 game in time for Kickstart, but they are welcome to use the SR2019 simulator.

**Resolution:**
4 in favour, 1 not present. Motion passed.

**Comment:**
Ultimately, Andy Barrett-Sprot made the necessary changes to the simulator to get it working. Thanks Andy!
