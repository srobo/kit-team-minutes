## Minutes

* Values of SR
  * Accessible
  * Autonomous
  * Open by default
  * Encourage creativity
  * Reflect reality
* What does it mean to have a vision?
  * Everyone acts in a way to further us towards a common goal
  * A vision should not be expected to be totally achieved - it's an ideal.
  * We should be regularly adjusting the vision to ensure we're constantly moving.
  * Ideas:
    * {Maximising,fulfilling,empowering} competitor {learning,development,experience,potential}
    * Life, liberty and the pursuit of robots
    * Help students {learn,discover their ability} to {make,engineer} amazing robots
    * Industry class, student built
      * Students are exposed to real world technologies with a carefully chosen level of abstraction
    * Bringing creativity and engineering to the surface
    * Open-ended, no correct answer
    * Real world robotics
    * Enabling, not teaching
  * Best one for now: "Empowering teams to discover their ability to engineer amazing robots"
* We have a number of stakeholders in our products/services:
  * Competitors: actually using the kit first-hand
  * Competition team: functionally a middleman, but they give the kit an application/purpose by building a competition around it
  * Volunteers in general: interacting with the kit comes naturally as part of supporting teams
* What are the attributes of a kit service that implements this vision?
  * Easily enabling a minimal viable robot / minimal awesome robot
  * Kit as a catalyst for students' imagination
  * Expectations matched to available resources
  * Kit works out of the box with a team of students (in regard to resources available at school)
  * Open-ended
  * Experience themselves
  * No prescribed process
  * Should be amazing for students
  * Should be amazing for spectators
* What is a subteam?
  * Group of people collaborating on a piece of work.
  * No more than about 6 people.
  * Subteams should have freedom to organise themselves how they see fit.
  * Committee should oversee operation of the subteam to ensure they are making reasonable progress.
  * Should keep in touch with the committee on a regular basis, so that they can express their progress and any issues they're having, and we can offer ways to help.
  * Idea: conferences - each subteam gets a chance to present their work to the rest of the kit team.
    * Aim to build a sense of community among the whole kit team
  * Idea: service manuals produced by development teams for use by asset management teams.
* Ideas for subteams:
  * Infrastructure team
    * Provide and maintain managed hosting services to the rest of the organisation
  * Support team
    * Provide support to users of the kit, both inside and outside events
    * Issues trickle down: teams -> mentors/forums -> support team -> domain experts
  * Asset management/maintenance team
    * Logistics, storage, tracking, maintenance (to the extent offered by service manuals)
  * "brain" software team
    * Robot API, operating system
  * Development tooling team
    * IDE, simulator, debuggers (e.g. tablet interface)
  * Hardware strategy team
    * Define precisely what is going to be included in the kit
    * Can construct temporary teams to design and manufacture new boards, working in collaboration with the firmware team.
  * Firmware team
    * Maintain and develop the board firmwares.
  * Robot perception and planning team
    * Vision and motion planning software
* Responsibilities of the committee (not an complete list):
  * Volunteer welfare
    * We should make it clear to volunteers that we can be contacted as individuals as well as a compound group.
  * Volunteer onboarding
    * This could be "outsourced" to a subteam if it's creating too much workload
* Openness of documentation
  * Balance needed between "open by default" and social implications of publishing something
* Kit Team <-> Competition Team challenges
  * Who owns team account management?
  * Who owns forums?
  * How to implement documentation?
  * How to manage tasks?
  * How to manage communication?
* How do we review our performance?
  * Surveys from teams
  * Metrics e.g. how long robots move for in matches
* How do we ascertain confidence that our software and hardware is stable? Two aspects:
  * Making sure it is sufficiently free of bugs:
    * Use Smallpeice summer school as a testbed?
    * Partial rollout
  * Ensuring that we provide a stable interface to the teams and avoid changing it while users are using it unless necessary.
* Inventory
  * There are a number of techncal and user experiences issues with this
  * Ultimately, what is the inventory needed for?
    * Knowing which teams have kit
    * We should conduct a more thorough investigation of this
* Licensing
  * Process documentation is prescribed to be CC-BY-SA 4.0
  * Open-source software licensing
    * Do we allow any open source license?
    * Do we only allow certain classes of license?
    * What happens if one party begins a project under license A, then developed is transferred to another party who agree than license B would be prefereable.
    * Some volunteers have personal preferences for copyleft or copyfree licenses; some volunteers may refuse to contribute to projects on this basis. We need to put personal preferences aside and decide what aligns most with the charity's values and kit team's vision.
* Ownership of battery safety/condition
  * This is an Asset Team thing.
  * Tom interested in taking this on until the Asset Team is set up.
* Geographically isolated volunteers
  * Communication should be remote-friendly and/or asynchronous
  * Dev kit
    * Where should it live?
    * By what process does a volunteer get access to it?
  * This is an Asset Team thing.
* Allocation of resources to teams
  * Teams propose what they could achieve with multiple levels of funding
  * Committee selects which combination of levels of funding across all teams would best fulfill the kit team vision.
* What happens when a project has no maintainers?
  * This is because there are no people left in the team that the project is owned by.
  * This means we should either find more people for the team, or abandon the team and project (or find an alternative solution).
* How do volunteers end up in teams? Are they assigned by the committee, or do they have free reign?
  * We'll see how things go.
  * Need to be careful not to end up with everyone in every team at once, because we already know that doesn't work.
