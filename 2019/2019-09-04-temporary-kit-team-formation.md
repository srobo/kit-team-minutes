# SR KTC motion passed via email on 2019-09-04: Temporary Kit Team formation

**Background:**
The kit team formed one week ago, and the SR2020 kickstart is approximately 1-2 months away. Therefore there is little time for us to work out a structure.

**Proposal:**
We delegate responsibility for getting the kit ready for SR2020
to Tom Wheal. This does not include any of the following:
 * The IDE
 * Shipping the kit to teams
The kit will be handed over to the competition team before kickstart by Tom
Wheal.  This responsibility will expire on the day after the SR2020 kickstart.

**Resolution:**
All in favour. Motion passed.
