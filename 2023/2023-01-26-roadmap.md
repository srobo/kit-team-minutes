Minutes to go here:

- Firmware Upgrades are already close to done
    - Except for ruggeduino and motor board firmware
    - Motor board firmware would be simple to write
    - Estimate includes time needed for the Python side
- Ruggeduino Firmware
    - More complex than board firmware as it's competitor facing
    - Focus on making a good API for students
