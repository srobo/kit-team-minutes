    - Tyler can arrange for batteries to be sent at the end of this week.
    - The team had been only using one battery. Considering how close we are to the competition, this isn't high priority.
    - By the time a battery would arrive, it would get there with around a week until the competition.
    - No action. We will hand them a replacement at the competition.
- Helpdesk
- List of things to document
