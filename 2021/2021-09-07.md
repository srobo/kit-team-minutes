## Topics

- Recovery of missing kit from SR2017, 2019 and 2020.
    - 4 / 6 kits from schools that returned are in Tom's Garage
    - Been unable to reach 14 schools - staff retiring
    - 18 kits are being kept by school. Safe to assume that they're good or can send spares
    - 8 kits in Tom's garage
    - Morse suggested sending signed letters to headmaster
    - Ask teams holding on to kits to audit them?
    - No hard number today

- Feasibility of shipping
    - We could drop vision. It would not be a huge amount of work
    - We've been able to give an alternative instead. Without vision how would they navigate?
    - No vision = more exciting lighting
    - Alternative = lots of ultrasound sensors
    - Off the shelf robots = money down the drain
        - Unless can resell or recoup money
        - Use as prizes?
    - No courier will accept existing batteries as they have not certification.
    - Should we be taking the risk of sending out uncertified batteries?
    - LiPos are possibly not storage charged, although not many teams have touched their kit?
    - CTC are open to suggestions re: what we ship
        - Maybe multiple regional competitions?

- Asset Audit
    - There's a lot of kit with old volunteers including RUBs
    - Most stuff is marked with an unknown state
    - All of the old kit is in there (v3)
        - We probably can't sell this now
        - Internals of boards are heavily bespoke
        - We probably won't ship these as kits again
        - Could maybe be broken down for parts

- Inventory software
    - Needs improving or replacing
    - Not necessarily our decision

- Runbook
    - Documentation should be in the same place. No fragmentation
    - Wiki used to work well
        - Easy to edit and update
        - Frictionless editing - no review process
        - More likely to be up to date
        - Using Mediawiki, you can link to previous revisions
            - Can be painful to look through
    - Historical docs should be archived
        - Useful in git history
        - Mostly useless - structure has changed
        - Reference for previous years is useful
        - maybe link at bottom of current page
    - Git is hard to use, especially for non-technical people

- Blog posts
    - Embedded Software in Rust

- Unplanned: Recruitment
    - Regional Competitions are a great place to recruit people

- Meeting Time
    - We agreed to meet at 7pm every other Tuesday for now.
