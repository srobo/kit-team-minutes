- Using Submodules for Yocto Development
    - Tyler has done some research on different ways to manage Yocto.
    - We need to do a test on how this would work, especially in regards to gitignore and symlinks
    - Everything is a git directory, so we'd need to be careful.
    - Josh P made a PR with submodules, as he uses Yocto a lot in his job.
        - The PR was built and ran 
    - We should keep the `meta-srobo` repository separate

        - could ship this running on the CPU
    - ABS using DNN - this was added to the image as it was just some compile flags for OpenCV
    - SOG using something else
