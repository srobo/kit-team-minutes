        - Provisional release date: 2023-01-01
- SR2022.1.0 Image - How did it go?
    - The release was late, but we did get it done.
    - Idea: Should we assign somebody to be the "release manager" next time?
        - Responsible for deciding what makes it into the release
        - Responsible for making sure that the image is ready and built with docs updated.
        - Responsible for comms with volunteers and team
        - One per release. Much like how the Yocto project do releases.
    - Action: We should formalise our processes for developing hardware/software
        - These should have task owners to keep them on track
        - Could create document templates for processes such as reviews, budgets, etc.
- SR2024 Kit Roadmap
    - [Document now available to add ideas](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LPeSuchNcsNS6P1QKz0Catd80kKYswcYzVnj0VsMaCo/edit)
