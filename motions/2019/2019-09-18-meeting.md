## Kanban board trial

**Background:**
Meetings tend to consist of a review of tasks that are in progress and discussion of a list of agenda points.
A kanban board provides a convenient way to track the status of tasks.
Agenda points fall neatly into this concept: they can be held in a "discussion" column and converted into actionable tasks if needed.
Rob recommends Github Projects. This would integrate nicely with our existing workflow (using Github issues to track tasks).

**Proposal:**
Try using a kanban board to direct our next meeting.

**Resolution:**
4 in favour, 1 not present. Motion passed.
