# SR KTC motions passed in meeting on 2019-09-03

Date/time of meeting: Tuesday 3rd September 2019, 19:30

Present: Kajetan Champlewski, Kier Davis, Rob Gilton, Dan Trickey, Tom Wheal


## Decision making process

**Proposal:**
Adopt the following rules as our process for formalising decisions:
* All decisions are to be made via motions of the KTC.
* In order to be proposed, a motion must be in writing -- even if it is being made in a meeting.
* Only members of the KTC can propose motions.
* Two mechanisms for making motions:
  * Email to kit-committee@studentrobotics.org with ``[proposal]`` in the subject line
  * By a vote overseen by the chairperson within a meeting
 Meeting validity: Meetings may only be considered valid for passing motions if the following conditions are all met:
  * At least 75% of the KTC is present (the "quorum").
  * It is possible to attend the meeting via a teleconferencing system.
  * 7 days notice have been provided by email to all KTC members (via kit-committee@studentrobotics.org in an email with ``[meeting]`` in the subject line)
* Decision making process in meetings:
  * A motion may only be passed if it receives votes of acceptance from more than 50% of the KTC members that are present.
  * In the event of a tie, the chairperson has the casting vote.
  * If the chairperson cannot attend the meeting, then the first action within the meeting must be to appoint a temporary chairperson, who is to be approved by a vote of the quorum.
* Decision making process in email:
  * A motion may only be passed by email if it receives votes of acceptance from _all_ of the KTC members.
* All passed motions must be recorded in the "ledger of motions".
  * For now, the ledger of motions shall be a clearly denoted section of the meeting notes.
* The changes that a motion describes cannot be performed or enacted upon until they are recorded in the ledger of motions.
* This decision making process itself can only be changed by either:
  * A motion proposed via email, using the process described above.
  * A motion voted on at a meeting, provided that it is accepted by more than 75% of the _KTC_ (not just the quorum for standard decisions).

**Resolution:**
All in favour. Motion passed.


## Key dates document

**Background:**
The trustees have distributed a document outlining key dates/timeframes for the upcoming competition year and asked us to review it.

**Proposal:**
Accept the document as-is.

**Resolution:**
All in favour. Motion passed.


## Python 3

**Background:**
The Competition Team recommended we upgrade the kit to support Python 3 this year. We agree that upgrading to Python 3 is a good idea, but it's infeasible to do it before Kickstart. We have the capability to roll it during the competition year via the IDE; this can even be done on a per-team basis. Shipping Python 3 may reduce the motivation for a larger overhaul of the API in time for SR2021 or SR2022.

**Proposal:**
Recommend to the Competition Team that Python 3 will not be supported at Kickstart, but it may be made available during the competition year subject to availability of kit team resources.

**Resolution:**
All in favour. Motion passed.
