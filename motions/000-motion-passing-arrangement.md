# Motion 0: Motion-passing arrangement

Proposed by Rob.

Background: Last week we discussed some rules for making decisions, but did not pass a decision on whether to adopt this process, as members of the committee had not had much time to read them.

Proposal: That we adopt the following rules for making decisions:
 * All decisions are to be made via motions of the KTC.
 * In order to be proposed, a motion must be in writing -- even if it is being made in a meeting.
 * Only members of the KTC can propose motions.
 * Two mechanisms for making motions:
     * Email to kit-committee@studentrobotics.org with ``[proposal]`` in the subject line
     * By a vote overseen by the chairperson within a meeting
 * Meeting validity: Meetings may only be considered valid for passing motions if the following conditions are all met:
     * At least 75% of the KTC is present (the "quorum").
     * It is possible to attend the meeting via a teleconferencing system.
     * 7 days notice have been provided by email to all KTC members (via kit-committee@studentrobotics.org in an email with ``[meeting]`` in the subject line)

 * Decision making process in meetings:
     * A motion may only be passed if it receives votes of acceptance from more than 50% of the KTC members that are present.
     * In the event of a tie, the chairperson has the casting vote.
     * If the chairperson cannot attend the meeting, then the first action within the meeting must be to appoint a temporary chairperson, who is to be approved by a vote of the quorum.

 * Decision making process in email:
     * A motion may only be passed by email if it receives votes of acceptance from _all_ of the KTC members.

 * All passed motions must be recorded in the "ledger of motions".
 * The changes that a motion describes cannot be performed or enacted upon until they are recorded in the ledger of motions.
 * This decision making process itself can only be changed by either:
     * A motion proposed via email, using the process described above.
     * A motion voted on at a meeting, provided that it is accepted by more than 75% of the _KTC_ (not just the quorum for standard decisions).
